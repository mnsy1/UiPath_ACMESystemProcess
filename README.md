# UiPath_ACMESystemProcess
This UiPath project automates a workflow that interacts with both the ACME System1 website and ACME System3 desktop application. It utilizes three custom libraries to streamline the process of extracting and updating work items from ACME System1 and searching for related data within ACME System3.
